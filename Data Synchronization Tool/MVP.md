# Data Synchronization Tool MVP

## Introduction

- Data synchronization tool represents a way to synchronize and transfer data between remote databases and local databases. The tool is designed to be used by developers and data engineers to facilitate the process of data synchronization and transfer.

- It is developed as a DataGrip plugin, which is a popular IDE for database management and development. The plugin is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface.


## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to be able to synchronize data between remote and local databases, so that I can work on my projects more efficiently.
- As a data engineer, I want to be able to transfer data between databases, so that I can maintain data consistency and integrity.
- As a database administrator, I want to be able to schedule data synchronization tasks, so that I can automate the process and save time.

## Features

- Connect to remote and local databases
- Select tables and columns to synchronize
- Preview changes before synchronization
- Schedule synchronization tasks
- Monitor synchronization progress


## Technology Stack

- Java
- Kotlin
- SQL
- DataGrip SDK


## MVP

- The MVP version of the data synchronization tool will include the following features:
  - Connect to remote and local databases
  - Select tables and columns to synchronize
  - Preview changes before synchronization (resolve conflicts)
  - Synchronize data between databases
  - Monitor synchronization progress

- The MVP version will be developed as a DataGrip plugin, with a simple and intuitive UI.
